# Requirements

## Initial requirements/deadlines (part of the 2. homework)
*Note: As an author I did not submit any requirements in second part of the homework, therefore this part will be empty*

## Final requirements/deadlines
*Note: Since there is only one author of the project, author name will not be specified at each line as specified in assignment*

* working SimulationLib2D (library for simulating collisions in 2D space) -- estimated: 27.04 2024, real: 29.04 2024
* working prototype of application for 2. homework -- estimated: 07.04 2024 , real: 29.04 2024
* runnable simulation (stop, resume working) -- estimated: 28.04 2024, real: 30.04 2024
* finished GUI -- estimated: 30.05.2024, real: 03.05 2024
* fully working reverse simulation -- estimated: 01.05 2024, real: 03.05 2024 *(Note: ManualRobot reverse simulating is not fully implemented and only sets robot to state when last command was given by the user)*
